# Welcome

Welcome to the first two days of the Learn AI Bootcamp. In these two days, we will focus on hands-on activities that develop proficiency in AI-oriented services such as Azure Bot Services, Azure Search, and Cognitive Services. These labs assume a introductory to intermediate knowledge of these services, and if this is not the case, then you should spend the time working through the pre-requisites.

# Pre-requisites

## Resources

- The ability to create resources within an Azure subscription
- Familiarity with how to create resources in said subscription

## Azure Bot Services

- We expect that you have already built your first bot, and have the relevant libraries to build and deploy these. Good introductory courses are available here:
  - LinkedIn Learning
    - [Part 1](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/creating-bots-with-the-microsoft-bot-framework-part-1)
    - [Part 2](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/creating-bots-with-the-microsoft-bot-framework-part-2)
  - Microsoft Virtual Academy
    - [Creating Bots in the MSFT Bot Framework](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-us/training-courses/creating-bots-in-the-microsoft-bot-framework-using-c-17590#!)

## Languages

- C# Proficiency and familiarity with REST APIs

# Goals

Most challenges observed by customers in these realms are in stitching multiple services together. As such, where possible, we have tried to place key concepts in the context of a broader example. 

At the end of this workshop, you should be able to:

- Understand how to configure your apps to call Cognitive Services
- Build an application that calls various Cognitive Services APIs (specifically Computer Vision, Face, Emotion)
- Understand how to implement Azure Search features to provide a positive search experience inside applications
- Configure an Azure Search service to extend your data to enable full-text, language-aware search
- Build, train, and publish a LUIS model to help your bot communicate effectively
- Build an intelligent bot using Microsoft Bot Framework that leverages LUIS and Azure Search
- Effectively log chat conversations in your bot
- Perform rapid development/testing with Ngrok and test your bots with unit tests and direct bot communication
- Effectively leverage the custom vision service to create image classification services that can then be leveraged by an application
