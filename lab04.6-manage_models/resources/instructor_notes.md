# Notes about the labs.

- I ran into some bugs working on the some of the labs. I reported them by encasing the issues in double brackets, e.g. [[at this point I get an error because...]].
- The model management lab has a lot of pre-requisites to get set up, but I think it's worth lengthening the lab and including the pre-reqs.
- The Conda lab is mostly derived from the presentation Jeremy gave about Conda best practices with Workbench.
- The BatchAI lab is really just replicating [this doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch-ai/quickstart-cli), but everything worked so I'm going to add new interesting bits and pieces if there's time.
